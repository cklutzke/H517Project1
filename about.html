			This data visualization was created by Carl Klutzke as an assignment for H517:
			"Visualization Design, Analysis, & Evaluation" at IUPUI in Fall 2018, taught by
			Khairi Reda. The purpose of the assignment was to reproduce Dr. John Snow's
			outbreak map (depicted below) as an interactive visualization using JavaScript
			and the D3 data visualization library.
		</p>
		<p>
			The street diagrams, pump locations, and death locations were provided as part
			of the assignment. The instructor also provided fictional demographic data
			for each death.
		</p>
		<p>
			To complete this assignment, I had to overcome the following challenges:
			<ul>
				<li>I had one month to complete the project.</li>
				<li>I had only three months of previous experience with JavaScript and CSS.</li>
				<li>This was my first project with the D3 library.</li>
				<li>I had to estimate the placement and rotation of the building and street labels.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

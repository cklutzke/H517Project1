				This data visualization was created by Carl Klutzke as an assignment for H517:
				"Visualization Design, Analysis, & Evaluation" at IUPUI in Fall 2018, taught by
				Dr. Khairi Reda. The purpose of the assignment was to reproduce Dr. John Snow's
				outbreak map (depicted below) as an interactive visualization using JavaScript
				and the D3 data visualization library.
			</p>
			<p>
				The street diagrams, pump locations, and death locations were provided as part
				of the assignment. The instructor also provided fictional demographic data
				for each death.
			</p>
			<p>
				To complete this assignment, I had to overcome the following challenges:
				<ul>
					<li>I had one month to complete the project.</li>
					<li>I had only three months of previous experience with JavaScript and CSS.</li>
					<li>This was my first project with the D3 library.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>

				work in germ theory, epidemiology, and data visualization, see

				I developed the visualization iteratively. I started by rendering the map,
				the pumps, and the death locations as the minimum viable product. The
				instructor provided a detailed rubric for how the project would be graded,
				and I added the graph and other features one by one according to those
				requirements and as my time and expertise allowed.
			</p>
			<p>
				I estimated the placement of the street and building labels by temporarily
				adding an onclick event to the map. This logged the location of each click
				for a starting estimate of the label placement. Afterward I commented out
				the event.
			</p>
			<p>
				The X scale of the graph was initially separate from an X rangeband scale
				that I used to draw the gray hoverbars. However, I couldn't get the bars to
				center over the drawn datapoints, probably due to rounding. I finally
				figured out how to use the same X scale to place the hoverbars, which makes
				much more sense than trying to keep a parallel scale in synch.
			</p>
			<p>
				I asked two subjects to provide user testing for the visualization. All I
				did was present them with the web page and ask them to interact with it.
				This helped me improve the display and clarify the accompanying text. One
				observation was that it is difficult to tell the different shades of green
				on the By Age graph apart. I experimented with different color schemes,
				but none of the alternatives seemed to be more clear. Categorical color
				sets of six colors were not colorblind-safe, and didn't convey a sense of
				increasing age. Diverging colorsets used pale colors in the mid-range,
				which weren't visible against the white background. In the end I decided
				that my initial green shading was as adequate a solution as I was likely
				to find.

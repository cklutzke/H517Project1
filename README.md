# H517Project1
Project 1 for my H517 Data Visualization class at IUPUI
http://vis.ninja/teaching/2018/H517/project1/

TODO:
A 2-4 minutes YouTube video showing the use of your visualization with narration. This video should be embedded in your documentation page.

Link to the video from the About page.

Upload the application to my website.

IF THERE IS TIME
Change the Y scale for the different modes.

Add dotted line with baseline death rates for comparison.

FOR AN A YOU NEED TO ADD:
	ability to zoom in/out and pan around the map
		https://github.com/d3/d3-zoom

	ability to cluster the data on the map into a grid that shows the number of dead in each grid cell (even with this small amount of data the points are starting to overwhelm) and the user should be able to vary the size of the clusters.

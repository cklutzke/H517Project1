# H517Project1
Project 1 for my H517 Data Visualization class at IUPUI
http://vis.ninja/teaching/2018/H517/project1/

TODO:
For a B you need to add:
additional graphs showing the distribution of deaths by sex and age overall
	Set up controls to toggle between modes.
	Clickin gon the key items should reduce their opacity.

For an A you need to add:
ability to zoom in/out and pan around the map
ability to cluster the data on the map into a grid that shows the number of dead in each grid cell (even with this small amount of data the points are starting to overwhelm) and the user should be able to vary the size of the clusters.
ability to show data from a window of days on the timeline graph

Presentation must be at most 4 minutes with 45 seconds Q&A.

# H517Project1
Project 1 for my H517 Data Visualization class at IUPUI
http://vis.ninja/teaching/2018/H517/project1/

TODO:
For a B you need to add:
additional graphs showing the distribution of deaths by sex and age overall
	Add key labels.
		Clicking on the key items should toggle their opacity.
	Add controls for display by age.

FOR AN A YOU NEED TO ADD:
address all the TODO items

ability to zoom in/out and pan around the map

ability to cluster the data on the map into a grid that shows the number of dead in each grid cell (even with this small amount of data the points are starting to overwhelm) and the user should be able to vary the size of the clusters.

ability to show data from a window of days on the timeline graph

Presentation must be at most 4 minutes with 45 seconds Q&A.

# H517Project1
Project 1 for my H517 Data Visualization class at IUPUI
http://vis.ninja/teaching/2018/H517/project1/

TODO:

For a C you need:
a timeline graph showing the number of deaths per day
	add axes
	draw invisible rects over each day to trigger hover events
	
ability to move the mouse over the timeline graph to choose which day to visualize - this should affect the deaths visible on the map and in the graph - at minimum all cholera deaths prior to that date should be shown on the map and the graph
the graph and the map should be stable (i.e., they should not move when new data is added or removed)
the graph and the map should be well labeled
you should check your visualization with a color blindness simulation tool to see that its OK
the map and graph should update quickly when the user interacts
an about screen with details on who wrote the project, where the data came from, etc.

For a B you need to add:
more data to the map - major street names and the location of the brewery and the work house
ability to easily see on the map whether each victim was male or female
ability to easily see on the map the age of each victim
additional graphs showing the distribution of deaths by sex and age overall

For an A you need to add:
ability to cluster the data on the map into a grid that shows the number of dead in each grid cell (even with this small amount of data the points are starting to overwhelm) and the user should be able to vary the size of the clusters.
ability to show data from a window of days on the timeline graph
ability to zoom in/out and pan around the map

Presentation must be 4 minutes with 45 seconds Q&A.

# H517Project1
Project 1 for my H517 Data Visualization class at IUPUI
http://vis.ninja/teaching/2018/H517/project1/

TODO:
For a C you need:
the graph and the map should be well labeled
an about screen with details on who wrote the project, where the data came from, etc.

For a B you need to add:
more data to the map - major street names and the location of the brewery and the work house
ability to easily see on the map whether each victim was male or female
ability to easily see on the map the age of each victim
	age 0-10      0
		11-20     1
		21-40     2
		41-60     3
		61-80     4
		> 80      5
additional graphs showing the distribution of deaths by sex and age overall

For an A you need to add:
ability to cluster the data on the map into a grid that shows the number of dead in each grid cell (even with this small amount of data the points are starting to overwhelm) and the user should be able to vary the size of the clusters.
ability to show data from a window of days on the timeline graph
ability to zoom in/out and pan around the map

Presentation must be at most 4 minutes with 45 seconds Q&A.

# H517Project1
Project 1 for my H517 Data Visualization class at IUPUI
http://vis.ninja/teaching/2018/H517/project1/

TODO:
Document the following on the ABOUT page:
	Describe how you used your visualizations to discover facts or answer questions you had. Include evidence to support your findings as screenshots from the visualization. In this case, we have a clear hypothesis to start with, but are there other nuggets of insights one can uncover?

A 2-4 minutes YouTube video showing the use of your visualization with narration. This video should be embedded in your documentation page. The video should be created using a screen-capture tool while interacting with the visualization. It should ideally be similar in style to the videos that accompany papers at the IEEE VIS or ACM CHI conferences. Here are a couple of good examples: UpSet, and GPLOM

Upload the application to my website.

IF THERE IS TIME
Change the Y scale for the different modes.
Add dotted line with baseline death rates for comparison.
It would be nice if, below a certain width, the graph dropped below the map.

FOR AN A YOU NEED TO ADD:
	ability to zoom in/out and pan around the map
		https://github.com/d3/d3-zoom

	ability to cluster the data on the map into a grid that shows the number of dead in each grid cell (even with this small amount of data the points are starting to overwhelm) and the user should be able to vary the size of the clusters.
